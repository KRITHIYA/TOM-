# TOM-
Touchless Oxygen Monitoring Device
TOM (Touchless Oxygen Monitoring) proposes a wrist-worn smart watch that gives users a smooth, non-invasive solution to monitor their oxygen level, heart rate and temperature for the detection of NIRAL-C (pNeumonia, Influenza, Rhino Fever, Anemia, Lassa Fever, Covid-19). Using the photodetector of the TOM watch, the suggested model begins gathering oxygen data from 280-700 nm LED sources [UVB (280-320 nm), UVA (320-400 nm), and visible (400-700 nm). Additionally, the framework is utilized to gather human input data, such as user-reported symptoms, and an integrated Artificial Neural Network is used to determine the type of fever. The built-in AI algorithm is trained using the NIRAL-C symptoms and default oxygen levels. After being trained, the model uses a deep learning technique based on user input and TOM output data to predict disease probabilities or classifications. The proposed TOM & NIRAL-C achieved an accuracy of 97% for the prediction of six classes of diseases. Our goal is to address the lack of predictive and user-friendly oxygen monitoring solution that combines touchless sensors with deep learning algorithms for fever prediction.
